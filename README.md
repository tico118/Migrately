Migrately is an application aimed at simplifying the U.S. visa and immigration journey combining the power of community and technology.  With over 14 million nonimmigrant visa applications a year, Migrately creates and tracks your process.  Migrately provides expert guidance with the most up-to-date information, saving users countless hours of research.  Migrately is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code.  This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the comments feature and the Video Chat feature that is powered by Daily.
